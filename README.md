# Librario
**See what your friends and community are reading!**

In the last few months, I've been reading more than coding in my free time. So I decided to build a web app that can store books I've read and the books I'd like to read in the future. Ideas for additional features came on soon after, such as seeing your friends library and what their currently reading.
