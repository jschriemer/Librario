# Librarius 0.0.0
**See what your friends and community are reading!**

In the last few months, I've been reading more than coding in my free time. So I decided to build a web app that can store books I've read and the books I'd like to read in the future. Ideas for additional features came on soon after, such as seeing what your friends are currently reading and posting about books (with spoiler tags of course!).

Timeline based app.
React cards to display book covers, along with text reviews, or in-book updates. (Along with spoiler tags)
Login portal. Follow feature. Friends + Community Filter.
Pull goodreads ratings?

**October 19th update:**
Added features include search bar that displays 10 results on cards displaying thumbnail, author, title and description.
